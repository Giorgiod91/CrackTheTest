Generate personalized tests automatically, analyze results, and classify difficulty with a small ML model.



# Backend with ML 
- https://github.com/Giorgiod91/CrackTheTest-Backend-With-ML

# Why ?
- i had to take multiple online tests but it wasnt that easy to learn specific content for the given position only expensive ones so i used openai to make my own test
- this app will also use open ai api and i build a small model that classify the  to get a good user experience just for ppl who want quick test for a low amount of money

# What do i Learn or Learned from this ?
-  How to work with Supabase and PostgreSQL
-  create my own Python backend and connect this to my Next js frontend and communicate with each other
-  Cors
-  Building and managing an API server with FastAPI
-  working with pydantic ( create Class and so on)
-  ML-Model Classifaction using embedding https://www.learnhuggingface.com/notebooks/hugging_face_text_classification_tutorial
